% The quiz questions and structure for each quiz
% Argument #1 is the number of questions. 
% #2 is a list of files that contain the questions. 
%     The questions will be written in that order.
% #3 is a list of lists. Each element corresponds to the question options for each file/question.
\allquestions{3}{trace,write}{{a,b,c,d},{a,b,c,d,e,f}}

% You can label your versions differently (but use letters only!)
% The labels here must match what is in the question file.
% I am using a, b, c, ...

% traceif and writeassign have random elements, so even though there is only 1 version,
% every time version a is invoked, it should produce a unique question
\quizversions{
    {a,a},
    {b,b},
    {c,c},

    % Must have comma after last list to recognize as a list. Not sure why???
    % Because of this last comma, one extra blank quiz version is created
