\qversion{a} {
Place 2 tiles next to each other in a row. Place the first tile at column 6, row 6. Place the next tile either to the right or left of the first, depending on the roll. If the user rolls less than 4, place the tile to the left of the first. Otherwise, a roll of 4 or greater means place the tile to the right of the first. Tiles can be any color.
}


\qversion{b} {
Place 2 tiles stacked in a column. Place the first tile at column 4, row 4. Place the next tile either above or below the first, depending on the roll. If the user rolls greater than 3, place the tile above the first. Otherwise, a roll of 3 or less means place the tile below the first. Tiles can be any color.
}
 

\qversion{c} {
Places 2 tiles next to each other in a row. Place the first tile at a random location based on the roll. If the user rolls 3 or less, place the tile at column 0, row 0. Otherwise, a roll greater than 3 means place the first tile at column 2, row 2. Place the next tile to the right of the first tile. Tiles can be any color.
