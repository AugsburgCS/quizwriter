% debugging: Inside quizsetup SETTING up the quizzes ...

% The quiz questions and structure for each quiz
% Argument #1 is the number of questions. 
% #2 is a list of files that contain the questions. 
%     The questions will be written in that order.
% #3 is a list of lists. Each element corresponds to the question options for each file/question.
\allquestions{3}{one,two,three}{{a,b,c},{a,b},{a}}

% You can label your versions differently (but use letters only!)
% The labels here must match what is in the question file.
% I am using a, b, c, ...

\quizversions{
    {a,a,a}, % question one option a, question two option a
    {b,b,a},
    {a,b,a},
    {b,a,a},  
    % Must have comma after last list to recognize as a list. Why???
    % Because of this comma, one extra blank quiz version is created
}

% debugging: Now I am done setting up. \\
